# Tienda — retail management tool

Multi-tenant retail operations for small Mexican retailers. Postgres (Supabase) +
React Native (Expo). MXN, IVA, LFPDPPP — not GDPR, CFDI out of scope.

**Read these two files before anything else:**

| File | Authority |
|------|-----------|
| [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) | Where the build is. Which step is next, what "done" means, what is unresolved |
| [`docs/adr/ADR-035`](docs/adr/ADR-035-target-architecture-postgres-react-native.md) | The architecture. **If anything disagrees with the ADR, the ADR wins and the other file is the bug** |

## What this is not

There is no React Native code yet — do not assume `.tsx`, hooks, or a package
manifest. The build is at the database layer (see `docs/PLAN.md`).

`archive/power-platform/` holds a Power Apps Canvas + Dataverse era that stopped on
2026-08-14. **Nothing there describes the system being built**, four of its ADRs are
provably false, and it is excluded from the knowledge graph via `.graphifyignore`.
Never cite it as current. Read it only for history, and say so when you do.

## Rules that are not negotiable

- **A file is not evidence; a green CI run is.** Every schema claim must trace to a
  migration CI has applied (ADR-035 §9). This repo exists in its current form because
  the last one recorded decisions that were never deployed.
- **Migrations are append-only once applied.** Fix forward with a new numbered
  migration. Numbering is fixed in [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md).
- **RLS is bypassed by the `postgres` superuser.** Any isolation check run as
  superuser passes vacuously. Test under `set role authenticated`.
- **Never edit `graphify-out/`** — it is generated.

## Domain vocabulary

Spanish module names are the domain language, not a translation layer: Comprar
(buy), Vender (sell), Productos (catalog), Proveedores (providers), Desperdicio
(waste), Números (reports). `workspace` is the tenant; `location` is the store —
they are not the same thing, and conflating them is a one-way door (ADR-035 §2.3).

## Working agreement

One task per session, taken from `docs/PLAN.md`. Estimate difficulty first; if the
task is large, split it in the plan before writing code, so the work survives a
context clear or a usage limit. Update `docs/PLAN.md` when a task closes.

**Merging is the owner's to approve and yours to execute** (settled 2026-08-17).
Push the branch, open the PR, report what CI actually said, and ask. On a yes, run
`gh pr merge`. Never merge unasked, and never ask before CI is green — an approval
given without a verdict is not the checkpoint `supabase/README.md` describes.

Local database: `supabase start` then `supabase db reset`. Add
`-x realtime,storage-api,imgproxy,kong,mailpit,postgrest,postgres-meta,studio,edge-runtime,logflare,vector,supavisor`
to bring up only what a migration reset needs.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost). Commits, merges and branch switches do this automatically on main/master via the git hooks; run it by hand for uncommitted work or on other branches.
- Every subagent prompt that involves code exploration must repeat these rules — subagents do not inherit them.
- The graph does not index SQL — graphify has no SQL parser. For `supabase/migrations/**`, read the files directly.
